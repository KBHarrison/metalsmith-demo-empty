<p>When a person is turning 70, they usually have family members who are approaching their forties.  The 70/40 rule was created as a launching point to help people start to think about what they are going to need as they age, who their support group is going to be, and emergency plans should their health suddenly start to decline.</p>
          <p>At the bottom of this page, there are steps listed that you should be thinking about.  The steps are not linked to anything.  They are just categories that could be considered.</p>
          <strong><h4>Pick someone to add to your bank account.</h4></strong>
          <p>When making this designation, you can tell your bank that the person can only have access to the funds if you are incapable of making decisions and it is verified by your doctor.</p>
          <strong><h4>Decide how you want to be cared for if you have a medical condition that leaves you unable to communicate</h4></strong>
          <p>If you become incapable of communicating, one of the hardest decisions for your family is to decide how long to keep you on mechanical support.  Deciding before and making your choices known is important to the peace of mind of your family.  They know they would be carrying out your wishes.  Some people sign a Do Not Resessitate form.  If they have stopped breathing or their heart has stopped, they do not want to be brought back.  Often, if they are brought back after they have stopped breathing or their heart has stopped, the quality of life is greatly diminished.</p>
          <strong><h4>Consider putting all of your assets in a Trust</h4></strong>
          <p>Using the trust to dictate how your property will be divided after death can be the biggest blessing for your family and can save years of ill-feelings among children.</p>
          <strong><h4>Get an idea of costs and choices of Funeral Packages</h4></strong>
          <p>The range of services is wide and the cost that goes with it can be very difficult for families. Some insurances are available with a small monthly payment that goes away with a death or when the cost is paid.  It is worth considering getting these insurance policies.</p>
