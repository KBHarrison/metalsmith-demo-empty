<p>Being the caregiver for someone who is declining in health is like navigating through a blizzard!  There are so many unknown factors and new paths to find and pursue.  The goal of this website is to provide families with information about where to turn when they are faced with the challenge of meeting the needs of a loved one who is declining. </p>
<p>Let me introduce myself.  My name is LeeAnn Sudbury. I graduated with a Master’s Degree in Gerontology and a Master’s degree in Social work.  My career emphasis has been on aging and declining health. I have been the caregiver for my own dying parents, the parents of my husband, and for 3 declining aunts and an uncle.  I have also had the privilege of serving many hospice patients prior to my
retirement. Let’s just say—I have been where you are!  
It is not the intent of this website to sell you anything. The site in informational only. Depending on where you live, you can research the companies available in your area.</p>
<p>
     The types of businesses you would look for would be Personal Care Agencies, Therapists, Home Health, Hospice, and Assisted Living or Skilled Nursing facilities.  There are many available, no matter where you live.  Choosing the options that will make you happy is a personal choice.  It would be best to visit and/or interview several in the category of help you need. It is also important to allow the person who is needing the help to be part of the decision if he/she is able to.  Involving them might help prevent depression or adjustment anxiety, especially if it is their desire to stay in their own home.</p>
          <p>
     One of the biggest mistakes families make is to expect religious leaders in the area to care for their loved one.  The responsibilities of religious leaders should be short term and supportive only.
