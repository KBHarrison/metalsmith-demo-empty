How long should a Church be involved with the care of someone? This is one of the most debated subjects among those who belong to a church.  Often people reach for spiritual help through their church in a crisis.  This is the way it should be. However, Church members tend to be “rescuers,” and, too often, they take over the responsibility that should belong to the family. Other times, family members expect their Church to take care of their loved one.  Both situations should be avoided. 
</p>
<p>
The information provided below is a guideline for making decisions. Church leaders and families might be inspired to do things differently, but the points discussed here are important things to consider.  In your situation, you may choose to use some of the ideas presented, or create your own plan.
</p>
<p>There are four categories of care to consider when the health of someone is declining. 
<ul>
<li>Physical care</li>
<li>Medical care</li>
<li>Spiritual care</li>
<li>Emotional care</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Putting the care needs into categories, helps us to decide who is responsible for which kind of care.</p>
<p>The <strong class="underline">physical care</strong> of someone who is declining belongs to the family, including feeding, bathing and dressing.  In a crisis, church members can provide meals and support for a short period of time, usually a week or two, while the family is finding resources to help them care for their loved one. It is also appropriate to support a family member who is doing the care.  Offer to give them a break by sitting with the person who is sick. </p>
<p>     It is never the responsibility of a church member to bathe, dress or feed a frail person.  All of those things can be very dangerous.  When a person needs help eating, they can choke or aspirate and die when someone, who is not trained, is feeding them.  When a person needs to get to the bathroom or take a shower, both the helper and the declining individual could end up on the floor. Meeting the dietary needs, especially sugar or salt restrictions, are not the responsibility of the Church. Friends and neighbors might end up preparing the wrong thing. In the short term, it is usually okay to provide meals, but as soon as possible, the nutritional needs should be taken care of by the family. When a church is overly compassionate and zealous, and the members take over the physical care of someone, it is not only a disservice to the family, but it often ends up causing more problems. It is not the Church’s responsibility to take away family blessings.  Family members often grow together as they meet the needs of a loved one.   </p>
<p>Speaking from the point of view of a family members, the total responsibility for care should not be given to just one family member.  It is too much responsibility. Sometimes one family member will step forward and take over, either because it is their nature, or they think they know more.  It is important that the members of a family insist on having a role. Everyone is blessed when they are able to participate in the care. If a lot of care is needed, family members can set up a schedule and take shifts.     </p>
<p>Whenever possible, involving the declining person in the decision making process and keeping them at home has been shown to have the best results. However, due to schedules and responsibilities, when it becomes necessary to make other arrangements, it is a good idea to research options.  You can start by reading the content from each of the tabs at the top of the page.  Many of the services mentioned are paid for through insurance and Medicare/Medicaid benefits.  Some, however, are only paid for short time. </p>
<p>If the person is declining rapidly, they may qualify for Hospice care, which is totally paid for through Medicare and Medicaid. You can always be creative and combine different types of care, but make sure you know which types are paid for and which types you may have to pay for. If your loved one’s needs cannot be met through one of these categories, or there is financial stress, contact the aging services in your area.  They may have ideas on how to tap into other resources.</p>
<p>The <strong class="underline">medical care</strong> of someone who is declining belongs to the medical profession and the family.  The Church and its members should not get involved in this aspect of care.  Giving pills, medical advice, dressing wounds, and other forms of medical care could complicate the problem if it is not done correctly.  Leave that job to the family, and let them get the advice and expertise of a medical team.  Keep in mind that the tabs at the top right of this page are helpful in accessing some of the medical resources. </p>
<p><strong class="underline">Spiritual care</strong> can be shared by the Church and the family. It is important for the church to be <strong>the backup, not the plan.</strong>  Families often have traditions and beliefs that are not shared by Church members.  It is best to offer to help, but let the family take the lead.  Inspirational cards and notes are always appropriate.  The spiritual leader of a congregation can be the go-between for families and the church.  If a church leader is prompted to get more involved, it is a good idea to follow those promptings.</p>
<p>The <strong class="underline">emotional care</strong> can be shared by the Church and the family. Visits, especially to shut-ins can do a great deal to lift the spirit of someone who is declining.  Visits and cards are the best kind of ministering one can do.  It is always a good idea to call first if you plan to visit.  Conversations should be kept upbeat.  Bringing a topic from a magazine or book can add interest to the conversation.  Or just coming once a week and reading a chapter from a good book can be something for the person to look forward to.  This type of emotional support is always appropriate.</p>
<p>In summary, keep in mind that Church members, although compassionate and willing, are not trained in nutritional needs, lifting, showering, or even regularly transporting people. Those tasks belong to the family or to the professionals that are available through their medical insurance or Medicare/Medicaid benefits.  </p>
<p>     The most appropriate way to be involved in ministering to someone’s needs is through comforting visits.  People who are sick are in need of emotional support as much as physical care.  The role of the church should be to support the spiritual and emotional needs of people. </p>
<p>     In our compassionate care, the subject of bringing meals seems to be the first topic we tend to bring up.  It is always appropriate for church members bring meals, if the family would like them, but this should only be done for a week to a month. At that point, the nutritional care should be given back to the family. </p>
<p>     Last of all, there are three important rules every Church should keep in mind when caring for someone in their congregation:
<ul>
<li>If the family is not taking care of the needs of the declining person, it is not the responsibility of the Church to come in and take over the physical and medical needs.  It is the responsibility of the Church to call Adult Protective Services at (800) 371-7897 (in Utah) or the Department of Child and Family services (801) 629-5800 (in Utah). These professionals can help the family access the resources they need, and can even help set up ways to provide for their care. By calling them, you are protecting people who may not be able to care for themselves.</li>
<li>If a person is alone and not able to get to the bathroom, prepare meals, get out bed or out of the house in an emergency, it is the family’s responsibility to arrange for the additional help that is needed.  It is against the law to ignore a situation where physical needs are not being provided. If a Church member is aware of a situation like this, it is their responsibility to call the agencies that are set up to make sure the needs are met.  It is not the responsibility of the Church come in and take over.</li>
<li>In rare circumstances where there is no family or extended family, a Church might get involved in arranging for the care of someone in their congregation.  Keep in mind there might be liability issues if the Church is caring for someone who needs professional care. With that in mind, sometimes the most compassionate way to care for someone is to use the professional resources that are available. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>     In rare cases, Church leaders and families may want to change the rules.  It is part of our divine nature to provide compassion and love as we serve and take care of each other. The Church leaders and the family should ALWAYS be aware of spiritual promptings.  </p>
