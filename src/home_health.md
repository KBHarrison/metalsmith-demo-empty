   <p>Home Health can be very helpful but the resources are short term and the conditions for getting it paid for are limited. Home health is usually paid for by insurance or Medicare or Medicaid, but the patient needs to fall within certain parameters in order to qualify for help.  The foundation for qualifying for home health is that you must be home bound due to illness or an injury.  Being “homebound” includes </p>
  <ul>
      <li>Needing help from someone else to leave your home</li>
      <li>Needing special transportation to get around</li>
      <li>Needing adaptive treatment</li>
      <li>Your doctor orders you to stay home due to some condition</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In addition to being homebound, you must ALSO meet these three qualifications:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Leaving home, even with help, is extremely difficult.</li>
      <li>You must have a doctor’s order. The doctor must verify and document that you are homebound. The order must be for reasonable and medically necessary home health services</li>
      <li>You must have visited your doctor recently (within 90 days) to receive a valid order.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>With the doctor’s order in hand, you may CHOOSE any home health agency that is within your network of providers paid for by your insurance.  You are not required to use the company that your doctor recommends, and if he does recommend one, you have the option of interviewing them and using them or someone else. Home health agencies will provide someone to come right to your home as part of the interview process.  Ask more than one to come before choosing who to use.</p>
  <p>When you are on home health, you can receive in-home therapies, paid for by your insurance (as described in the “Therapy” section of this website).  These services can be very helpful for getting you back to a place of independence. For questions about home health, be sure to call Medicare (1-800-Medicare) before starting services.  Not all services recommended by your doctor will be covered by Medicare.  If the service is not covered, you can decide if you are willing to pay for the service from your own funds.</p>
  <p>If you do not qualify for the paid services described here through Home Health, you still have options. You can consider Palliative Care or you can go back to the possibility of paying, out of your own funds, for Private Duty, Personal Care and/or Therapy.  Using these options is much less expensive than going to an Assisted Living facility.  If you have a life threatening condition, you can also be evaluated for Hospice. Hospice is the least understood benefit available as you decline.</p>
