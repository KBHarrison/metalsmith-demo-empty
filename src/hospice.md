<p>People often wait to call hospice until there are only a few days or a few weeks remaining in a person’s life.  This has resulted in people thinking that Hospice is only available when someone is dying.<sup>4</sup>  That mindset is the most misunderstood concept about hospice care! Hospice is a benefit under Medicare that belongs to the patient. When patients enter hospice, it is because they qualify for the benefit and choose to access it.<sup>5</sup> 
</p>
          <p>Hospice in available long before death is imminent. Sadly, even some doctors are not aware of all the ways that hospice can be beneficial.  If you or your doctor are not sure, contact your state hospice agency or NHPCO.org for more information.</p>
          <p>Hospice is available to use whenever someone is faced with a serious, life threatening illness.  To qualify for hospice, the illness would be estimated to cause dramatic decline and potentially death in six months. Symptoms might include sudden weight loss or weight gain, dizziness, trouble breathing, frailty or weakness.  These symptoms could be signs of a life-threatening, terminal condition. Rather than just throwing up your hands in despair, discuss Hospice with your primary care physician or contact a hospice agency for a medical evaluation. Hospice can be used on a short-term basis and the result might be improved health.  Once there is a marked improvement in a patient's condition, the patient’s doctor would reevaluate six-month prognosis and take the patient off hospice<sup>5</sup></p>
          <p>Hospice is always appropriate when a person is rapidly declining and the decline could lead to death.  When a person is on hospice, some services are no longer paid for by Medicare or Medicaid such as curative care and some types of therapy.  However, when on Hospice, a patient is very supported in their frailty.  This includes a visit from a nurse, usually weekly; a visit in your home from your Hospice doctor about every three months; personal support for bathing/showering; sometimes light housekeeping and meal preparation can be included if the personal care takes less than one hour.</p>
