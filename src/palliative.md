<p>Palliative Care relieves symptoms and stress due to serious, incurable illnesses.  It provides comfort, not cures.  If your needs qualify under the home health services, and if you meet all of the required home health guidelines, you can receive Palliative Care through a home health agency.<sup>3</sup> </p>
      <p>However, if you have a condition that could result in death in six months or fewer, you might want to consider using Hospice.  Hospice provides more care and it is paid for by Medicare/Medicaid. If the condition you have is not a terminal disease, there is a possibility that Hospice can provide the care and attention that you need to get you back to better health.</p>
