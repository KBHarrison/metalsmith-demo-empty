<p>For some people, Assisted Living is the answer.  In an assisted living facility (ALF), a person usually has their own apartment.  Meals are offered, restaurant style, in a community setting.  Some apartments provide the ability to do limited cooking in a microwave. They offer refrigeration and resemble independent living.  The ALF apartments usually consist of a small living room-kitchen combination, a bathroom, and a bedroom.  In some ALFs, the bedroom, kitchen area and living room are combined.  Smaller ALFs can be as low as $2500 per month.  Nicer ALFs can range upwards to $10,000 per month. </p>

          <p>Assisted Living apartments can be appealing to someone who has declining health, but is still mostly independent.  They also appeal to people who are either no longer take care of a home or yard or someone with a spouse who is declining. There is often a nurse on staff and support for an emergency.  Some places will even take dementia patients to a different part of the Assisted Living facility during the day to give a spouse respite from the constant care. The care for the spouse increases the price of the ALF.</p>
          <p> ALFs also appeal to someone who can afford to travel and no longer wish to be tied down to caring for a home.  Of course, those who are willing to pay more will have a larger, more elaborate living arrangement.  Assisted Living facilities can be a very good choice for some. They are beautiful and offer independent living along with support for meals or help with a declining spouse.</p>
          <p>It is important to note that some people confuse assisted living facilities (ALFs) with “skilled nursing facilities” (SNFs).  People needing 24/7 care do not usually qualify for Assisted Living Facilities. Most ALFs require the person to be pretty independent because they only provide minimal support. When a person has declined so much that they need care most of the day and most of the night, or can no longer get to the bathroom, a skilled nursing facility is probably the answer.  That being said, however, it is also important to note that Assisted Living Facilities are offering more and more support for a price.</p>
          <p>It is also import to note that when a person has chosen to live in an ALF, they are still eligible for the other services that are offered through Medicare.  That includes YOUR CHOICE of home health, hospice, physical therapy, and palliative care.  Sometimes the ALF will tell their residents that they are required to use their programs for these services.  BE AWARE THAT THEY MUST STILL GIVE YOU A CHOICE.  For families who want their loved one to decline at home or in an ALF that has become their home, Hospice is a good option to add to their care.</p>
