<p>When a person starts to decline, if there isn’t a family member who can stay with them, often, it is less expensive to hire someone to provide some of the care right in the home.  There are licensed, professional companies that specialize in private duty care. Sometimes, under specific circumstances that are deemed applicable by Medicare, the cost of that care can be supplemented through Medicare Benefits.   </p>
  <p>Traditional Medicare and Health Care Insurance companies do not pay for the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>24 hour care</li>
  <li>Meals delivered to your home</li>
      <li>Personal care, such as bathing, dressing and using the bathroom (if these are your only needs)</li>
      <li>Transportation and shopping services</li>
      <li>Services that your doctor may order, but that the entity who might pay for them (Medicare or Insurance) do not consider them reasonable or necessary</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Personal Care or Private Duty agencies specialize in providing qualified caregivers for hire.  These professionals provide non-medical assistance with any or all of the following needs:  bathing, dressing, eating, meal preparation, medication reminders, companionship, walking, transferring from bed to chair and back, light housekeeping and transportation.  
Personal Care or Private Duty Care is usually paid for by the family and the 2019-2020 cost of personal care is around $25-35 per hour. These services might be used for short term breaks for family members to take a vacation or a rest, or for daily, long term care, or for a medical need that requires nurses’ visits.

  <p>There are a few questions to ask yourself when thinking about Private Duty or Personal Care.  Does your loved one need help 24/7 or care for just a few hours each day?  Are their family members, including adult grandchildren who could spend an hour or so helping each week?  Make sure when you make the decision to hire someone for Private Duty or Personal Care, that you are using them only to supplement what you cannot do as a family. </p>
  <p>     It is also important to consider that if your loved one is incapable of getting in and out of bed, or in an emergency, could not get to a safe place, it is against the law to leave them alone.  However, if they are mostly okay on their own, you could consider providing a medical alert necklace or wrist band.  Some can even be activated by a fall or the push of a button.  Once activated, calls are automatically made to you or someone you have specified to receive those emergency calls.  </p>
  <p>If finances are an issue, you might try contacting your local health department or aging services to  inquire if there are Medicaid waiver programs available. If your loved one or their spouse is a Veteran, there is a possibility they are eligible for assistance. Contact the VA Administration for details.</p>
