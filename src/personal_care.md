<div class="text-paragraph">

<p>When a person starts to decline, if there isn’t a family member who can stay with them, often, it is less expensive to hire someone to provide some of the care right in the home.  There are licensed, professional companies that specialize in private duty care. Sometimes, under specific circumstances that are deemed applicable by Medicare, the cost of that care can be supplemented through Medicare Benefits.   </p>
  <p>Traditional Medicare and Health Care Insurance companies do not pay for the following:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>24 hour care</li>
  <li>Meals delivered to your home</li>
      <li>Personal care, such as bathing, dressing and using the bathroom (if these are your only needs)</li>
      <li>Transportation and shopping services</li>
      <li>Your doctor may order services that Medicare, Medicaid, or your insurance provider  do not consider reasonable or necessary.  To keep from having to pay for services out of pocket, always check with your health provider before accepting or arranging for the service ordered. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Personal Care or Private Duty agencies specialize in providing qualified caregivers for hire. These professionals can support your family with non-medical assistance that may include any or all of the following needs: bathing, dressing, eating, meal preparation, medication reminders, companionship, walking, transferring from bed to chair (and back to bed), light housekeeping, and transportation. Personal Care and Private Duty Care is most often, paid for by the family.  The 2019-2020 cost for personal care is around $25-$35 per hour.   You can hire a private duty caregiver for a couple of hours per day, or for a few hours per week, or even for a full week at a time, so that family members to take a vacation or a rest.  You can also hire Personal Care agencies for long-term caregiving or nurse’s visits.

  <p>There are a few questions to ask yourself when thinking about Private Duty or Personal Care.  Does your loved one need help 24/7 or care for just a few hours each day?  Are there family members, including adult grandchildren who could spend an hour or so helping each week?  Make sure when you make the decision to hire someone for Private Duty or Personal Care, that you are using them only to supplement what you cannot do as a family. </p>
  <p>     It is also important to consider that if your loved one is incapable of getting in and out of bed, or in an emergency, could not get to a safe place, it is against the law to leave them alone.  However, if they are mostly okay on their own, you could consider providing a medical alert necklace or wrist band.  Some can even be activated by a fall or the push of a button.  Once activated, calls are automatically made to you or someone you have specified to receive those emergency calls.  </p>
  <p>If finances are an issue, you might try contacting your local health department or aging services to  inquire if there are Medicaid waiver programs available. If your loved one or their spouse is a Veteran, there is a possibility they are eligible for assistance. Contact the VA Administration for details.</p>
